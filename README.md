# Penetration Testing Toolkit (Python)
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based educational project developed as part of an internship task to demonstrate fundamental penetration testing concepts. This toolkit is designed to help learners understand how basic security testing tools work internally while maintaining a strong focus on ethics, modularity, and clarity.
Penetration testing involves evaluating systems for security weaknesses by simulating potential attacks in a controlled and authorized environment. This project does not perform real-world exploitation and should only be used for learning purposes or on systems owned by the user or where explicit permission has been granted.

## Project Overview
This toolkit follows a modular architecture, where each penetration testing concept is implemented as a separate module. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Users can easily understand individual components without dealing with unnecessary complexity.
The toolkit is operated entirely through a menu-driven command-line interface, making it simple and accessible even for beginners. All modules rely solely on Python’s standard library, ensuring compatibility and ease of setup.

## Modules Included
1. Port Scanner
The port scanner module demonstrates how network services can be discovered by scanning common ports on a target system. It attempts to establish socket connections to predefined ports and reports which ports are open. This helps learners understand:
How services listen on ports
How attackers and security professionals identify exposed services
The importance of closing unused ports

2. Brute Force Simulation (Educational)
This module simulates the logic behind brute-force attacks using a predefined wordlist. It does not perform real authentication attacks but instead demonstrates:
How password-guessing logic works
Why weak passwords are vulnerable
The importance of strong authentication mechanisms
The module is intentionally simplified to maintain ethical use and learning focus.

## Features
Modular toolkit design for clarity and scalability
Scans common ports on a target system
Displays open ports with associated service names
Demonstrates brute-force logic using a predefined wordlist
Simple and interactive command-line menu
Uses only Python standard libraries
Beginner-friendly code structure with clear separation of concerns

## Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
No external libraries required
This ensures the toolkit can be run on most systems without additional setup.
