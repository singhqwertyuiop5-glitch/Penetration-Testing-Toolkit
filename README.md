# Penetration Testing Toolkit (Python)

This project is a Python-based penetration testing toolkit developed as part of an internship task. The toolkit demonstrates fundamental penetration testing concepts through a modular and ethical approach. It is designed strictly for educational and learning purposes.

The toolkit includes multiple modules such as a port scanner and a brute-force simulation module. Each module is implemented separately to maintain modularity and clarity. The tool runs via a command-line interface and is intended to be used only on systems owned by the user or where explicit permission has been granted.

## Modules Included

- Port Scanner  
- Brute Force Simulation (Educational)

## Features

- Modular toolkit design
- Scans common ports on a target system
- Displays open ports with associated services
- Demonstrates brute-force password logic using a predefined wordlist
- Simple menu-driven command-line interface
- Uses only Python standard libraries

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- No external libraries required
